Open the file "ultralytics-yolo11-main" using PyCharm. In the terminal, run the command: `yolo detect train data="yaml file path" model=yolo12n.pt epochs=300 imgsz=640 batch=16 lr0=0.01 workers=8 patience=20 optimizer=SGD`. After the task is completed, the results will be saved in the "runs/detect/train" path. Then, use the validation test set code. Add the file paths as specified in lines 10, 11, and 13, and run it to obtain a "predictions.txt" file.
